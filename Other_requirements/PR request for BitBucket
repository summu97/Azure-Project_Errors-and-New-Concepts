Got it 👍 — you want to be notified whenever developers create PRs in **Bitbucket** before merging. Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to configure it. I’ll cover **Bitbucket Cloud** (common) and mention Data Center where it differs.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Enforce Pull Request Workflow

1. Go to your repository → **Repository settings**.
2. Under **Workflow → Branch permissions**, add rules:

   * Protect `main`/`master` branch.
   * Require **Pull Request** before merging.
   * Optionally, enforce **minimum reviewers** (e.g., 1 or 2).

## 🔹 Step 2: Add Default Reviewers

1. Go to **Project settings → Default reviewers**.
2. Add yourself (or your team) as a default reviewer.
   ✅ Now, whenever someone creates a PR, you’ll automatically be added as a reviewer and get notified.

## 🔹 Step 3: Configure Merge Checks

1. Go to **Repository settings → Merge checks**.
2. Enable:

   * ✅ Minimum number of reviewers must approve.
   * ✅ All required builds must pass (if using Jenkins/GitHub Actions).
     📖 [Docs: Require checks before merge](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/suggest-or-require-checks-before-a-merge/)

## 🔹 Step 4: Notifications

You have options depending on how you want to receive PR alerts:

### 📧 Email (default)

* Bitbucket automatically emails reviewers when a PR is created or updated.

### 💬 Slack/MS Teams

* Go to **Repository settings → Slack → Settings**.
* Connect your Slack workspace.
* Enable notifications for:

  * PR created
  * PR commented
  * PR approved/declined
    📖 [Docs: Slack integration](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/integrate-bitbucket-cloud-with-slack/)

### 🔗 Jenkins (for CI checks)

* Install **[Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source/)** or **[Bitbucket Push and Pull Request Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/bitbucket-push-and-pull-request/)** in Jenkins.
* Create a **Multibranch Pipeline job** in Jenkins.
* Jenkins will auto-detect PRs and run builds.
* Configure build status to be sent back to Bitbucket, so PRs show ✅ / ❌ build results.
  📖 [Plugin guide](https://github.com/jenkinsci/bitbucket-branch-source-plugin/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.adoc)

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Test the Flow

1. Developer raises a PR → You are auto-added as reviewer.
2. You get **email / Slack notification** immediately.
3. Jenkins runs PR pipeline → Updates PR with build status.
4. Merge is only possible after approvals + passing build.

---

✅ This setup ensures:

* No one merges directly to `main`.
* You always get notified when a PR is raised.
* Jenkins builds validate PRs before merging.

---

Do you want me to also give you a **Jenkinsfile snippet** that runs only on PR builds (so Jenkins validates PRs automatically)?
