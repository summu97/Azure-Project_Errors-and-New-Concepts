WAF vs Firewall — What’s the Difference?
| Feature              | **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**                                                          | **Traditional Firewall / NSG / Azure Firewall**             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Layer**            | **Layer 7** (Application Layer: HTTP/HTTPS)                                                 | **Layer 3/4** (Network & Transport: IP, Port, Protocol)     |
| **Purpose**          | Protects **web apps** from **web-specific threats** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, bad headers) | Controls **network traffic** (who can access which IP/port) |
| **Understands HTTP** | ✅ Yes – It can inspect URLs, cookies, headers, etc.                                         | ❌ No – It only sees IPs and ports                           |
| **Example Use Case** | Block a malicious POST request with a harmful payload                                       | Block SSH access from all IPs except one                    |

So what does WAF do beyond a firewall?
WAF does more than just restrict access — it analyzes the content of the HTTP request:

Detects if the request is trying to attack your app

Can block things like:
Malformed JSON
Suspicious user-agents
Bots scraping your website
SQL or JavaScript injected in a form

🧠 Think of it like this:
🔐 Azure Firewall / NSG: “Who is allowed to talk to my server?”
🛡️ WAF: “What are they saying in the request — and is it dangerous?”


----------------------------------
✅ Option 1: Both Applications Use Private IPs (Internal Communication via VNet Peering or VPN)
🔹Use Case:
Both apps are hosted inside private networks (e.g., Azure VNets or hybrid on-prem).
The APIs are not exposed to the internet — only internal/private IPs.

🔹Solution:
Use VNet Peering or Site-to-Site VPN (if across different regions/orgs/clouds).
Allow only the required source IP/subnet in Network Security Groups (NSGs).
Example NSG Rule:

Allow: Source IP → Destination: Your API's private IP → Port: 443 (HTTPS)
Deny: Everything else (zero trust)

🔹Benefits:
Secure, private communication.
No exposure to the public internet.
Easier to monitor and control.

✅ Option 2: Remote App Uses Public IP → Redirect to Internal API (with Firewall Rule)
🔹Use Case:
The calling application is external and accesses APIs using public IP.
Your app is hosted internally on private IP.
You want to expose it selectively to that external app.

🔹Solution:
Use Azure Firewall / NAT Gateway / Load Balancer to map:
Public IP → Internal IP

Example: Requests to FirewallPublicIP:443 get forwarded to 10.0.1.4:443

Add firewall rules to allow:
Only source IP of external app
On specific port
Optional: Add TLS mutual authentication or API keys

🔹Benefits:
Only whitelisted external app can access your internal API.
No need to expose full private subnet.
Traffic logging and control via firewall.

✅ Bonus Option 3: Use Azure Application Gateway + WAF (for HTTP/S APIs)
If the API is HTTP/HTTPS:
Use Azure Application Gateway with WAF as the entry point.

It can perform:
SSL termination
Request routing
Load balancing
Web firewall protection

🔐 Security Note:
Always use HTTPS and JWT/API Key/Auth Header for API requests.
Monitor with Azure Monitor, NSG Flow Logs, or Application Insights.
