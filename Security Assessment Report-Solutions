Container with privilege escalation should be avoided:

What It Means
Your container is running with settings that allow it to gain more privileges than it needs, potentially escalating to root-level access inside the container or on the host.

How to Fix It
In Your Pod/Deployment YAML:
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false

Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: my-app:latest
      securityContext:
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
        runAsNonRoot: true
        capabilities:
          drop: ["ALL"]

Containers sharing sensitive host namespaces should be avoided:

What It Means
This refers to Kubernetes containers configured to share certain host namespaces, such as:
| Namespace Type | Description                                           | Risk Level     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `hostPID`      | Shares **host process ID namespace**                  | 🔥 High        |
| `hostIPC`      | Shares **host inter-process communication namespace** | 🔥 High        |
| `hostNetwork`  | Shares **host network stack**                         | ⚠️ Medium–High |

How to Fix It?

1. Disable Host Namespace Sharing in YAML
Update your Pod/Deployment definitions:
spec:
  hostPID: false
  hostIPC: false
  hostNetwork: false

Better: remove those fields completely, as they default to false.

2. Use Pod Security Admission (PSA) or OPA/Gatekeeper Policies
Kubernetes PSA (in v1.25+) or PodSecurityPolicy (deprecated) can block pods with hostPID: true, hostNetwork: true, etc.
OPA/Gatekeeper example constraint:

apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sPSPHostNamespace
metadata:
  name: disallow-host-namespaces
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        kinds: ["Pod"]

What It Means
By default, containers have a writable root filesystem, which means:
Applications can write files anywhere inside the container (including /).
Malicious code or attackers can modify files in the container at runtime.

How to Enforce Read-Only Root Filesystem
In Kubernetes Pod or Deployment YAML:

spec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp
      image: myimage:latest
      securityContext:
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true

If your app needs to write to a location:
Mount a writable volume (like an emptyDir or PVC):

      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /tmp
          name: tmp-volume
  volumes:
    - name: tmp-volume
      emptyDir: {}
---
What Does It Mean?
By default, in Kubernetes:

Every Pod is automatically mounted with a ServiceAccount token (a JWT) that gives it access to the Kubernetes API server.
This token is mounted at:
/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token

This allows containers to authenticate to the Kubernetes API (usually with limited permissions).

Best Practice
If a container does not need access to the Kubernetes API, explicitly disable the automounting of API credentials.

How to Disable Automounting
At the Pod/Deployment Level:
spec:
  automountServiceAccountToken: false

Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: no-token-pod
spec:
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: myimage

At the ServiceAccount Level (Recommended for Groups of Pods)
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: sa-no-token
automountServiceAccountToken: false

Then attach this SA to your pods:
spec:
  serviceAccountName: sa-no-token

When Should You Disable It?
| Pod Type                                      | Should You Disable? |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| App pods that don’t need to talk to K8s API   | ✅ Yes               |
| Simple web servers / databases / backend APIs | ✅ Yes               |
| Monitoring agents or controllers that use API | ❌ No                |
| CI/CD runners (depends on need)               | ⚠️ Maybe            |

Least privileged Linux capabilities should be enforced for containers:

In a Pod/Deployment YAML:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: my-image:latest
      securityContext:
        capabilities:
          drop: ["ALL"]

Or in a Deployment:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: secure-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: secure-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: secure-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: myimage:latest
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              drop: ["ALL"]

Privileged containers should be avoided:

1.  In Your Pod/Deployment YAML
Simply do not set privileged: true. By default, containers run as non-privileged.

If you want to explicitly disable it in a pod spec:
securityContext:
  privileged: false

2. Use Pod Security Admission (PSA) in Kubernetes
Kubernetes now has built-in Pod Security Admission which enforces security standards including blocking privileged containers.

Apply a namespace label to enforce a security level, for example restricted which disallows privileged containers:
kubectl label namespace your-namespace pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted

The restricted policy disallows privileged containers by default.

3. Use OPA Gatekeeper or Kyverno Policies
You can write policies to deny any pod spec with privileged: true.

Example Gatekeeper Constraint (deny privileged containers):
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sPSPPrivilegedContainer
metadata:
  name: deny-privileged
spec:
  enforcementAction: deny

Or a Kyverno policy snippet:
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: disallow-privileged
spec:
  rules:
  - name: check-privileged
    match:
      resources:
        kinds:
        - Pod
    validate:
      message: "Privileged containers are not allowed."
      pattern:
        spec:
          containers:
          - securityContext:
              privileged: false

| Method                   | Description                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Pod Spec                 | Set `privileged: false` or omit it |
| Pod Security Admission   | Label namespaces with `restricted` |
| OPA Gatekeeper / Kyverno | Enforce policy to deny privileged  |
| Admission Controllers    | Use built-in or custom controllers |

Running containers as root user should be avoided:

Run as Non-Root User
How to enforce non-root user in your Pod/Deployment YAML:
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1000   # UID of a non-root user inside container

Or per container:
containers:
- name: app
  image: myimage
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1000

What if Your Image Only Has Root User?
Use Dockerfile commands to create and switch to a non-root user:
RUN useradd -m appuser
USER appuser

---
Usage of host networking and ports should be restricted:

How to Restrict Usage
1. Audit and Remove hostNetwork: true in Pod Specs
Make sure pod YAMLs do not set:
hostNetwork: true
